Breath never stays the same for an instant, but it can be a stable support. So try to practice this way, just staying aware of your thoughts, and not chasing them.</div> <div class='stanza'>Thoughts come and go. No problem. Register sounds, sensations no problem. Take note of discomfort in your body, agitation, restlessness. Fine. Be with the clarity of mind, with the clarity of mere knowing. Knowing without concepts. Knowing without the grasping impulses of the ego-self, or knowing without fixation. This connects you to your own inner reality, your inner wisdom.</div>"
