This great <a href='https://elisabethirgens.github.io/notes/2020/09/to-all-jobs-i-had-before/'>Blog Post</a> by @elisabethirg gave me the idea to look back at all those odd jobs I had before becoming a developer and the lessons I learned from them. </p><hr/><h2>\ud83c\udf4e Asparagus Picker: There is real value in being a part of the community</h3>     <p>This was my first real job. I was 14 working on my neighbors farm where I helped them pick asparagus and run their farmers stand. The farmer stand seemed to always be profitable despite the fact that all our locally sourced produce was noticeably more expensive then what you would see at the grocery store. The reason for this was because the owner was very knowledgable, he knew a good bushel of peaches when he saw it and if the peaches didn't look good, he wouldn't sell them. He maintained this honest and dependable relationship with the community and people kept coming back.</p><hr/><h2>\ud83e\uddf9 Store Clerk: Sweep Twice, Mop Once</h3><p>In the summers while I was in highschool I worked at a small general store scooping icecream, stocking shelves, running the cash register, and cleaning the store. The owner had a single rule for cleaning the store floors at the end of the day. Sweep twice, mop once. Going back and resweeping always resulted in a cleaner store and he could tell if we didn't sweep twice. I try and maintain this mentality whenever possible whether I'm writing a blog post, building a webapp, or cleaning the kitchen. It may not seem like much but catching those typos and other obvious mistakes quickly can make noticeably difference in the end result.</p><hr/><h2>\ud83d\ude9a Dock Worker: It's OK to slow down</h3>     <p>Once I turned 18 I was finally able to get a non minimum wage job at a local milk processing plant. I worked on the recieving dock, unloading crates of milk from trucks. All of us on the dock tried to get the truck unloaded as quickly as possible. But one day we had to unload a trailer full of milk that had been left out in an unrefigerated truck for a few days in the summer sun. We were so focused on emptying the truck as fast as possible that one of us slipped while dragging a stack of cartons and spilled about 24 gallons of spoiled milk all over the dock. I will never forget that smell. Sometimes its better to be less efficient but more stable. Here's a great article from Psyche on this topic: <a href='https://psyche.co/ideas/why-efficiency-is-dangerous-and-slowing-down-makes-life-better'>Why efficiency is dangerous and slowing down makes life better</a></p><hr/><h2>\ud83d\udcf1 Mobile Phone Sales: Learn how to explain things</h3>     <p>This job mainly consisted of stocking phone chargers and explaining the difference between the iPhone 6s and the Galaxy s6. It could be frustrating, the phone's names were similar, they looked the same, and they had similar hardware. The patience and conversational skills I learned from helping explain the differences to customers has remained useful.</p><hr/><h2>\ud83c\udf55 Pizza Delivery Guy: Some jobs are better then others</h3><p>I got this job when I came home for the summer of my freshmen year. I loved delivering pizza, I got to work late at night, drive my car, listen to my music, and make money?! The only downsides to this job was that customers were rude and it made my car smell like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. So I guess the lesson is 'maybe give pizza delivery a try?'.</p>", ""], [5, "08/29/2020", "", "US", "Clay Brimm", 1, "My Introduction to VR Development", "Using Oculus Quest2.", "<h1>My Introduction to VR Development</h1>     <h2>08.29.2020</h2>     <div class='content-video'>       <iframe width='560' height='340' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jilN1LYgQLg' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen></iframe>     </div>     <p>It seems like there are more and more interesting developments in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (XR). It is an exciting technology that has made some significant advances and has become more accessible and more impressive. The price of a decent VR headset has decreased and the number of released VR games is increasing. But there still is room to grow. It\u2019s speculated that Virtual and Augmented Reality (XR) will be one of the technologies to benefit from the adoption of 5G. If this was to happen we could expect to see headsets with less hardware required and more of a reliance on cloud computing. This also seems like a good time for XR to be more widely adopted. It seems that the Covid-19 Pandemic has accelerated the acceptance of remote work and I think that XR could play a pivotal role in skilled remote labor. There is a growing need for professions that would benefit from XR,  <a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/drone-pilot-school/515022/'>semi-automated drone pilots being an example</a> I think that we can expect to see growth in similar XR business opportunities.  All of this to say, XR is the future and it\u2019s exciting. I want in on it!</p>     <p>I had not paid much thought to developing in XR, the main reason being the high cost of the hardware and the expected pains of being an early adopter. But the Oculus Quest (owned by Facebook), released in 2019 seemed like a great device to start VR development with. This is a standalone headset that does not require a beefy desktop to run. The headset itself is an Android device that does have some processing limitations but it offers 6 Fields of Motion and it runs a number of popular VR apps such as Super Hot and Beat Saber. Quick sidebar: I think the idea of a standalone headset running Android is interesting sign of how Facebook views the future of XR and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the future versions of the Quest have 5G capabilities. I purchased the 64GB Oculus quest and have been overwhelmed with how exciting this technology is, I quickly wanted to get in and make something. </p>     <p>I intend to use Unity Game Engine for developing on the Quest. Setting up the Oculus and Unity for VR Development was not difficult thanks to some good documentation found online. There seems to be a growing amount of quality content on Unity VR development, the YouTube Channel <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJlesN59MzHPPCp0Lg8sLw'>Valem</a> has a great introductory series that I have been going through. Following his tutorials I made my first VR game, a bowling game that is sure to make Wii Sports look like child\u2019s play. While it doesn\u2019t look like much, there really is something magical about being able to make something on my computer, press a few buttons, put on a headset and be instantly transported into my own project, its very cool. Overall I am impressed with how easy this was to get into developing for VR, I hope to keep documenting my progress and I encourage everyone to give VR a try!</p>", ""], [6, "10/25/2021", "", "US", "Clay Brimm", 1, "Stage Fright", "Thoughts about the internet", "<p>The Internet is such a powerful tool. It has integrated so seamlessly with our sociey that it has become difficult to imagine life without it. At 24 years old I can barely remember life before the iPhone, the Internet has been the nexus of my social life, hobbies, university studies, and career. It is a tool that was available to me all my life, it is a part of me. But as I have matured, my relationship with the web and my habits around it have changed.</p> <p>The biggest change that I see is that I have become a lurker, not a creator. A lurker is someone who accesses social networks but does not generate content. The majority of users on all major platforms fit into this category. It's not uncommon but I wasn't always this type of user. When I first started using Facebook in middle school I immediately started posting to my wall and interacting with friends. But as I matured and my social media sites changed I became less likely to post or share content. I would like to touch on a few of the major factors I see in this change from user to lurker.</p> <p>I think the first factor in my lurking habit is the fear of negative feedback. William Osman, an engineering YouTuber posted a video today speaking about his exasperation with the negativity he receives on his channel https://youtu.be/DVCpKfedfok . In this video he talks about the small but constant stream of negativity that he and other creators recieve. This is a universal problem on the internet. Any dive into a YouTube video comment section, or active subreddit, or Twitter thread and you are guaranteed to find negativity, bullying, and pointless criticism. We have given an equal and often anonymous voice to everyone, this negativity is side product. This feedback loop of negativity is not constructive and it is stifling to creativity, I believe that platforms should take this issue more seriously, but we cannot wait for social networks to fix this problem. We still need to create, we still should be willing to face the feedback loop and not be discouraged. And we should all be good to one another and not contribute to the negativity.</p> <p>The second reason for my lurking is the unknowable risk of the Internet. I believe that the conversations and fears of online cancel culture are widely overstated. While there are surely positive and negative examples of social media's power to change public opinion, the fact of the matter is that the internet is our society. It is a public space, and when you are in public there are social standards that you are expected to fit into. It is also a permenant place, whatever you or someone else chooses to share can be on the web forever. When you post or say something online, you may not be able to control how loud your voice is. Your Facebook post could be potentially viewed by ANYONE. You encounter a unknowable risk when you interact with the internet, this should not be forgotten.</p> <p>The final reason for my lurking, is a lack of trust. Living in the age of the Internet has made me paranoid. I don't trust any social media site to be able to fix these problems. These companies don't want to make the changes necessary to improve these problems either because its not feasible or it would lose them money. These problems with the Internet I have talked about are human social issues not technological hurdles. We have created the echo chambers, the negative feedback loops, and the flame wars, we overshare and we bully. The Internet is a giant social machine that contains some of the best and worst parts of humanity. Those who want to create will have to adjust to this new era and find ways to use the internet for good.</p>", ""]]
