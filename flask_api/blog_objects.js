But one day we had to unload a trailer full of milk that had been left out in an unrefigerated truck for a few days in the summer sun. We were so focused on emptying the truck as fast as possible that one of us slipped while dragging a stack of cartons and spilled about 24 gallons of spoiled milk all over the dock. I will never forget that smell. Sometimes its better to be less efficient but more stable.
